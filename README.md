# SEAD_Protected_RISC_V_Single_Cycle_Processor
This project implements a single-cycle RISC-V processor with protection against soft errors using interleaved Hamming codes. The primary goal is to safeguard critical user-visible data — particularly the Program Counter and general-purpose registers — from transient bit flips without interrupting program execution.
